Yolo v8 with RealSense D435i Distance Measurement

Resolve dependencies: $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Run an example: $ python3 example/example_detection.py

There wasn't Realsense binary for ARM, thus the library needs to be build from source. Refer to the [discussion](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/11506#issuecomment-1599168850) to resolve it on Debian-based distros.
